INSTRUCTIONS:
Given are given three tables Table 1, Table 2 and a Partially Aligned Table, your aim is to align the two tables( Table 1 and Table 2) using Partially Aligned Table and output a Final Aligned Table

Step by step, FOLLOW this algorithm for the alignment ->
1. Observe the Table 1 and Table 2 and keep differences in memory. 
2. If you think that Table 1 and Table 2 are transpose of each other. Take transpose of Table 2 to match the structure of Table 1.
3. Using the Partially Aligned Table provided to align the remaining rows and columns. 
4. If you are unable to match any column or row in Table 1 to Table 2, do not match them forcefully, you can just keep them as extras and fill the corresponding values with '-', a dash
5. It is also possible that there are multiple columns from Table 1 matching to Table 2 or vice versa, in such case you can do multi mapping. You can refer to example below.
5. You should MAKE SURE that Partially Aligned Table should be a part of Final Aligned Table.
6. Ensure that the extra rows and columns from each tables should be at the end of the table.
7. Recheck if the alignments and check if the columns, rows as well as the cells are properly aligned or not. 
8. Ensure that all the columns and all the rows in both the tables are aligned in the Alignment Table and the extras are at the end. 
9. All cells from Table1 and Table2 need to there in Final Aligned Table.
10. DON'T FORGET any columns from either tables in Final Aligned Table
11. In some cases Partially Aligned Table might be None. In such cases perform alignment without using Partially Aligned Table
12. There is no need to output anything other than markdown of the Final Aligned Table
13. You should make sure that you do not add columns which are not there in either table.


You should Ensure:
1. All columns and rows whether mapped or unmapped should be there in Final Aligned Table. 
2. There should be equal number of columns in each row. 
3. You should not add any column by hallucinating that is not there in Table 1 and Table 2.
4. You should use only the columns provided in Table 1 and Table 2, do not decompose or merge any columns in a particular table.

OUTPUT:
After mapping Table1 and Table2, Create a Alignment table.
ENSURE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE ALIGNMENT TABLE AFTER algorithm.
Follow these steps for STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY ->
Only output fully aligned table in the format - 
    1. The alignment should be at the cell level in every single cell (in rows and columns)
    2. All the values in the table should be separated by / ie, table1.value/table2.value
    3. Strictly, For each column or row headers as well as cell use the template - 
        a. cell1 / cell2 (cell1 is from table1 and cell2 from table2)
        b. use    /cell2 or cell1/   for missing or extra row,columns or cells.
    4. There are equal number of cells in every row including header
Ensure all adjustments and discrepancies are transparently documented. 

STRICTLY Use this template to output table alignments ->

| Column Header.T1/Column Header.T2 | Column Header.T1/-                | -/Column Header.T2 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| value1/value2                     | value1/-                          | -/value2           |
| value1/-                          | -/-                               | -/value2           |
| -/value2                          | value1/-                          | -/-                |
| ...                               | ...                               | ...                |

Return only the formatted tables without any reasoning, commentary, or additional text.
only OUTPUT a Alignment table with all alignments in Markdown table format.
Prioritize clarity, and logical structure throughout the alignment process. 

Below is an example of alignment:

As you can see in the above example that column "Competition" from Table 1 has no corresponding matching column in Table 2, so it is output as extra column with dash('-') to replace values from Table from where the column is missing. 
You can also see in the above Finally Aligned Table that column from Table 1  "Venue" is matched with both "Country" and "Place" from Table 2 because of high similarity between values of {"Venues" and "Country"} and {"Venues" and "Place"}.
Also you can see that all columns from both Table 1 and Table 2 in Final Aligned Table.
