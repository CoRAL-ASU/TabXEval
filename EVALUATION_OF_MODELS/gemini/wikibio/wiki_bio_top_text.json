(dean jones suffered a similar fate in the west indies). when smoke from bushfires made visibility difficult at melbourne in the 4th test of the 1897/98 series, the english captain claimed that play should cease because of bad light. umpire phillips was unimpressed, saying that \"if that light was bad, then cricket had better be given up entirely at bramall lane, bradford, and old trafford.\" an english player remarked that australia was the only place where the country was set alight just to win a cricket match. on retirement, phillips became a mining engineer and is reputed to have made a fortune in north america.",
