You are a text to table generation agent. Given a text description, generate appropriate tables from the text shared.
I am attaching a few sample inputs and outputs with this message to help you understand how you have to do it. 


Example1: 
Given Text : michelle schimel was new york state assemblywoman in portuguese heritage society.
Table : | title | portuguese heritage society | <NEWLINE> | subtitle | other activities | <NEWLINE> | name | michelle schimel | <NEWLINE> | office | new york state assemblywoman |

Example2: 
Given Text : alfred cahen was secretaries general of the western european union in 1985–1989.
Table : | subtitle | list of secretaries general | <NEWLINE> | name | alfred cahen | <NEWLINE> | years | 1985–1989 |

Example 3:
Given Text : sveriges television the truth about marika won international emmy award in 2008.
Table : | subtitle | interactivity | <NEWLINE> | year | 2008 | <NEWLINE> | best interactive tv service | the truth about marika | <NEWLINE> | network | sveriges television |

Final output structure. 
Then convert the table in the exact format as specified in this examples. 
1. For all of the remaning rows, output the correponding values.
2. Each cell will be separated by a "|" sign.
3. Your output should be in the format "Final Answer:" <output table/tables in specified format>. Stick to this format as postprocessing your output will be easier
